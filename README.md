#### Group E - User Input

### 1. Instructions on how to interact with the work
1. Click anywhere on the canvas to change a random colour for each blob.
2. Click on the canvas to create a ripple effect at the mouse position.
3. Press the UP ARROW key to increase the size of the blobs.
4. Press the DOWN ARROW key to reduce the size of the blobs.

### 2. Details of your individual approach to animating the group code.
**User Input: Incorporate mouse or keyboard inputs for animation.**

I focus on user input to create interactive animations that respond directly to the user’s action.

**mousePressed interaction:**
- Each blob changes to a random colour every time the user clicks on the canvas.
- A ripple effect appears wherever the mouse is pressed.

**keyboardPressed interaction:**
- Pressing the UP_ARROW increases the size of the blobs.
- Pressing the DOWN_ARROW reduces the size of the blobs.

These features make my animation different from other group members. While other group members have focused on perlin noise, audio and time-based animations, my animation focused on the user’s interaction with the artwork through mouse and keyboard control.

### 3. References to inspiration for animating your individual code.
**Visual Inspiration**

The inspiration for the mouse ripple effect came from the circle patterns in the centre of each blob from our group artwork. These circle outlines reminded me of water ripples, which share a similar layered and expanded form.
